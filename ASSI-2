# Arithmetic Operators:
# Arithmetic operators perform mathematical calculations.
# Addition
a = 5 + 3
print(a)  

# Subtraction
b = 10 - 4
print(b)  

# Multiplication
c = 2 * 6
print(c)  

# Division
d = 15 / 3
print(d)  

# Modulo (Remainder)
e = 16 % 5
print(e)  

# Exponent
f = 2 ** 4
print(f)  
# Assignment Operators:
# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.
# Simple assignment
x = 10

# Add and assign
x += 5  

# Subtract and assign
x -= 3  

# Multiply and assign
x *= 2  

# Divide and assign
x /= 4 

# Modulo and assign
x %= 3  

# Exponentiate and assign
x **= 2  
# Comparison Operators:
# Comparison operators compare two values and return a Boolean result.
# Equal to
a = 5
b = 7
print(a == b)  

# Not equal to
print(a != b) 

# Greater than
print(a > b)  

# Less than
print(a < b)  

# Greater than or equal to
print(a >= b) 

# Less than or equal to
print(a <= b) 
# Logical Operators:
# Logical operators perform logical operations on Boolean values.
# Logical AND
a = True
b = False
print(a and b)  

# Logical OR
print(a or b)  

# Logical NOT
print(not a)  
# Bitwise Operators:
# Bitwise operators perform operations on individual bits of integers.
# Bitwise AND
a = 0b1010  
b = 0b1100  
print(bin(a & b)) 

# Bitwise OR
print(bin(a | b)) 

# Bitwise XOR
print(bin(a ^ b))  

# Bitwise NOT
print(bin(~a))  

# Left shift
print(bin(a << 2)) 

# Right shift
print(bin(b >> 2))
